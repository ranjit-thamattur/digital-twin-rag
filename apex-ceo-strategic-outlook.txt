APEX ENERGY SOLUTIONS: EXECUTIVE STRATEGIC OUTLOOK Q1 2026
Confidential - For Marcus Sterling (CEO) Only

1. STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS
Our primary objective for Q2/Q3 2026 is the successful acquisition of 'NorthSea Drilling Partners'. We have allocated $4.2 Billion for this maneuver. This will increase our offshore footprint by 35%.

2. STOCK PERFORMANCE
Apex Energy (APX) currently trades at $142.50. We are projecting a 12% dividend increase following the NorthSea merger.

3. EXPLORATION CAPITAL
We are shifting $500M from traditional coal assets into our 'DeepWater Alpha' exploration project in the Gulf of Mexico. Projected yields for DeepWater Alpha are 400,000 barrels per day starting 2028.

4. REGULATORY OUTLOOK
Federal safety audits are expected in June. We must ensure Rig X-45 and Rig Z-12 are fully compliant to avoid the $50k daily non-compliance fines.
